> Disregarding the electricity cost, how much can I get in USD for mining XMR in
  24 hours using an AMD EPYC 9965 CPU?

To determine the estimated USD revenue, we need the hashrate, the current Monero
(XMR) price, and the current network difficulty.

1.  Hashrate (AMD EPYC 9965):

    224.77 KH/s (Kilohashes per second) ≈224,775 H/s
1.  Current Monero Price (XMR to USD):

    Approximately $287.76 USD per XMR (as of the search results).
1.  Estimated Daily Monero (XMR) Mined (based on current network stats):
    Using a profitability calculator with the given hashrate (and typical Monero
    network data like a network hashrate of ∼5.5 GH/s, and a block reward of
    ∼0.60 XMR):

    The AMD EPYC 9965 with a hashrate of 224.77 KH/s is estimated to mine
    approximately 0.015 XMR per day.
